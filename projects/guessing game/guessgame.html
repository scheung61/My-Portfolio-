// when is true != true?  What should our condition actually be?

// Part 2: Also display how many tries the user has left

// Convert the users guess to a number

// Use an if statement to see if the player's guess is equal to the random one generated

// Use an else statement to notify the user if they guessed incorrectly

// Part 2: Inside the else statement, tell the player whether their guess is too small or too big, Hint: you'll need to use an if statement

}

// Part 2: If the user runs out of guesses, tell them what the correct number is.  Hint: What variable did we use to define it?
